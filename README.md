# Daily Morning Message Automation

This project automatically sends personalized good morning messages to your loved one via email using Python's `smtplib`. The message is randomly selected from a list of custom messages and sent to the recipient each day.

## Features

- Sends a random good morning message via email.
- Customizable message list and recipient.
- Uses Gmail’s SMTP server for email delivery.

## How It Works

1. The script selects a random message from the predefined list.
2. It sends the selected message to the recipient via Gmail’s SMTP server.
3. Each message is sent with a unique greeting each time the script runs.

## Customization

- Update the sender's email address (`agapwtomimimou@gmail.com`).
- Change the recipient’s email address (`nagiagiannousa165@gmail.com`).
- Modify the `texts` list with your personalized messages.

## Example Output

```text
Subject: Exete Mail apo to mimi sas:

Hey mimi moy iloveyou :(
